Chicago Notes is a corpus of math definitions created by Lucy Horowitz and used as a part of the project MathGloss.

Chicago notes, as a plain text file, consists of 1644 sentences in the file https://github.com/vcvpaiva/Lucy/blob/main/plain.txt 

From these notes 500 concepts were extracted and connected to WikiData, by Lucy, in the file
https://github.com/MathGloss/MathGloss/blob/main/alignments/chicago-maps.txt

We know there are some 120 Chicago concepts not mapped to Wikidata in https://github.com/MathGloss/MathGloss/blob/main/chicago.md

What I want to do now is to see what GPT-4 makes of extracting the concepts in Chicago notes. 
at least the 620=500+120 concepts manually extracted by Lucy should be there.

If we use the method we outlined in our preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00642 we can use mathAnnotator to check the other concepts.
