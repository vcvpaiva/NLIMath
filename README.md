# Math Concept Identification and NLI Math

A repo for  experiments in "math concept identification" using the TAC corpus and the nLab corpus. (and first thoughts about NLI for mathematics.)

The TAC corpus can be found at https://github.com/ToposInstitute/tac-corpus.

A selection of 436 sentences of the TAC corpus (some are empty), selected by size (not too big, not too small) and lack of LaTeX is in
https://github.com/ToposInstitute/tac-corpus/blob/main/golden-attempt/examples.txt and is repeated here for convenience as Experiment2.txt.

The nLab corpus (from around 2020) is at https://github.com/ToposInstitute/nlab-corpus.


Short guidelines for mathematician annotation already  agreed:

1. Try to treat math concepts as black boxes, as much as possible.

2.  Use the singular, instead of the plural, for concepts.
  
3.  If one has a long span that is a concept, e.g. “enriched accessible categories”, we should also list the sensible subspans like “accessible category”.

A subset of the sentences  have no mathematical concepts at all, e.g. "Further applications are given."
